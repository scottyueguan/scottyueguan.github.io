<b>Research Statement: </b>
Heuristics are informative advice or prior knowledge for deciding which among many alternative actions renders the most effective choice to accomplish some goal.
They are the fundamental and essential tool for an intelligent agent with limited computational resources to solve complex decision making or planning problems.  My research leverages more generalized interpretations of heuristics which allow utilizing richer information about the problem to help solve complex problems by focusing the computational effort on exploring only the consequences of the relevant actions to reach some desired objective.
