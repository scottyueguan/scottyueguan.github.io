I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 
advised by [Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras](https://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html) in the [Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory (DCSL)](https://dcsl.gatech.edu). 
My research interests lie in scalable multi-agent decision-making, game theory, optimal control, 
and integration of these fields in the context of cyber-physical systems.

<h2>Research Experience</h2>

**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), August 2020 - Present<br>
*Graduate Research Assistant*

My Ph.D. research with Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras focuses on developing efficient algorithms for autonomous systems with large numbers of agents operating in complex or contested domains. 
I am specialized in the development of scalable multi-agent decision-making algorithms leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning and mean-field approximation.  
Aside from providing theoretical performance guarantees, I also conduct experimental validation of the developed algorithms integrated into various robotics platforms. 

**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), August 2018 - May 2020<br>
*Graduate Research Assistant*

During my M.S. research with Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras, I focused on developing frameworks for modeling autonomous systems with bounded-rational agents (level-k thinking) 
and a computation-efficient learning algorithm in zero-sum stochastic games (SNQ2) with provable convergence guarantees.
My coursework was concentrated on linear/nonlinear control, optimization, machine learning, and orbital mechanics.  

<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), August 2018 - Present<br>
*School of Aerospace Engineering - Graduate Teaching Assistant*

I assisted with developing problem sets, graded homework and held office hours. 
Courses includes:
ECE 8803 Online Decision-Making,
AE 6580 Optimal Control, and
AE 8803 Mathematical Principles of Planning and Decision-making for Autonomy.



**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), August 2015 - May 2018<br>
*School of Mathematics - Undergraduate Teaching Assistant*

I was an undergraduate Math teaching assistant for the Georgia Tech Honors Program. 
I gave lectures as the head TA and assisted in developing problem sets and test questions. 
Courses include: 
MATH 1553-HP Honors Linear Algebra, 
MATH 1502 Calculus II,
MATH 2551 Multivariable Calculus, and
MATH 2552 Differential Equations.

I was recognized for excellence in instruction as the **Outstanding Undergraduate TA** from the School of Mathematics in 2018 (one of the two recipients).
