I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering (AE) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras](https://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html) in the [Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory (DCSL)](https://dcsl.gatech.edu/). My research interests lie in path planning, motion planning, and multi-agent path finding problems for autonomous mobile robots.

<h2>Research Experience</h2>

**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), August 2018 - Present<br>
*Graduate Research Assistant*

My Ph.D. research with Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras focuses on solving
path planning, motion planning, and multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems
using <i>generalized</i> heuristics search algorithms.
I am specialized in theoretical development of the heuristic search algorithms with a bounded (sub)optimality guarantee and experimental validation of the developed algorithms
integrated in various robotics platforms.

**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), May 2018 - May 2020<br>
*Graduate Research Assistant*

During my M.S. research with Prof. Panagiotis Tsiotras, I focused on implementing
a machine-learning based trajectory optimization algorithm,
Game Theoretic Differential Dynamic Programming (GT-DDP)
on a quadrotor for optimal control under unstructured disturbances.
My coursework was concentrated on linear/nonlinear control, optimization, and rotorcraft design.


<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), August 2021 - Present<br>
*Vertically Integrated Project - Graduate Teaching Assistant*

The VIP program is an undergraduate education program designed to provide students from multiple disciplines a research experience in a team mixed of sophomores through Ph.D. students.
I have helped students setting up an autonomous navigation stack for a 1/10 scale robotic car platform processed by NVIDIA Jetson TX2, equipped with latest sensors including ZED camera, IMU, and Hokuyo UST-10LX LiDAR.
I have also developed an online planning stack and a user-interface in ROS for the Open Motion Planning Library based planners to quickly replan in a dynamic environment, as a part of the full autonomous navigation stack.

**Georgia Institute of Technology** (Atlanta, GA), Aug 2017 – May 2018<br>
*AE4610: Dynamics and Control Laboratory - Graduate Teaching Assistant*

Dynamics and Control Laboratory is a course designed to give undergraduate aerospace engineering students a hands-on experience with system modeling, control system design, analysis, and evaluation of different controllers in various platforms.
I assisted instructing the students to use MATLAB/Simulink for design and implementation of PID and LQR controllers.


<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
**LG Chem Ltd., R&D Center** (Daejeon, South Korea), July 2016 – Sept 2016<br>
*Automobile Battery Validation Team - Intern*

Before joining the Dynamics and Control Systems Laboratory, I assisted the LG validation team engineers to collect and analyze the performance data of lithium-ion battery prototypes in extreme environment tests for design validation to meet clients’ requests.
